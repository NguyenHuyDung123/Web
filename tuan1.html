    <p>One particular book which ia recommended reading is <u>The Street Lawyer</u> by <u>John Gwrisham.</u> This book is about a lawyer who begins re-evaluating his priorities in life when a bad incident occurs within his law firm. Consequently, he becomes
        acquainted with the inner city streets, and reakizes the harsh existence of the homeless, and vows to give them a chance in the courts. <u>The Street Lawyer</u> is a <i><b>great</b></i> book. It is <i><b>well writen</b></i> and <i><b>interesting.</b></i>Other
        books by <i>John Gwrisham</i> incluse <u>The Firm, The Pelican Brief,</u> and <u>The Client</u></p>
